### Welcome to Polymatrix-Games

Polymatrix games is library of games useful for testing game theoretic algorithms.
The library was built as an extension to the currently existing GAMUT library of
games due to its lack of games which were hard to solve for approximate algorithms.
With that in mind, we built this library as a test suite for approximation
algorithms. There are currently two projects hosted :

- Algorithms <https://github.com/polymatrix-games/polymatrix-algs> : This contains
  implementations of various algorithms for the approximation of Nash equibrium.
- Game Library <https://github.com/polymatrix-games/polymatrix-generators> : This
  contains the implementations of several classes of games which were introduced
  to study their properties with regards to approximation.
